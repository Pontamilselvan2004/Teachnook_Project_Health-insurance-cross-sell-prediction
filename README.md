# Teachnook_Project_Health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing customer data to predict whether policyholders who previously purchased health insurance will also be interested in vehicle insurance. The goal is to help the insurance company optimize its business model by targeting potential customers more effectively.

## Business Context

Insurance companies provide various policies, including health and vehicle insurance. Understanding customer behavior and predicting interest in vehicle insurance based on demographics, policy details, and vehicle attributes can enhance decision-making.

By using historical customer data, we aim to build a machine learning model that predicts interest in vehicle insurance. This can improve marketing strategies, increase revenue, and streamline operations.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer details, including:
- **Demographics**: Gender, Age, Region Code
- **Vehicle Details**: Vehicle Age, Damage History
- **Policy Details**: Premium, Sourcing Channel


## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables
   - Feature selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize customer distributions
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Model Building**
   - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Hyperparameter tuning

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
